                    Maria Oksentiyivna Prymachenko (Ukrainian: Марія Оксентіївна Примаченко; 12 January 1909 [O.S. 30
                    December 1908] – 18 August 1997) was a Ukrainian folk art painter, who worked in the naïve art
                    style. A self-taught artist, she worked in painting, embroidery and ceramics.

                    In 1966, Prymachenko was awarded the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine. The United Nations
                    Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared that 2009 was the year of
                    Prymachenko. A street in Kyiv and a minor planet are both named after her. Pablo Picasso once said,
                    after visiting a Prymachenko exhibition in Paris, "I bow down before the artistic miracle of this
                    brilliant Ukrainian."

            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>
                    Prymachenko was born to a peasant family and spent the majority of her life in the village of
                    Bolotnia, currently in Vyshhorod Raion, Kyiv Oblast, situated only 30 km (19 mi) from Chornobyl.[1]
                    She attended school for four years, before contracting polio, leaving her with a physical
                    impairment, which impacted her life and art.[2][3] She described her first artistic experiments in
                    later life: "Once, as a young girl, I was tending a gaggle of geese. When I got with them to a sandy
                    beach, on the bank of the river, after crossing a field dotted with wild flowers, I began to draw
                    real and imaginary flowers with a stick on the sand… Later, I decided to paint the walls of my house
                    using natural pigments. After that I've never stopped drawing and painting."[4]

                    During childhood, Prymachenko's mother taught her embroidery, and by the late 1920s or early 1930s
                    she was a member of the Ivankiv Co-operative Embroidery Association.[2] Her talent was recognised by
                    the artist Tetiana Floru, who invited Prymachenko to work at the Central Experimental Workshop of
                    the Kyiv Museum of Ukrainian Art in 1935.[2]

                    In Kyiv, Prymachenko underwent two operations, which enabled her to stand unaided.[2] Also, she met
                    her partner, Vasyl Marynchuk, there. In March 1941, their son Fedir Prymachenko [uk] was born in
                    Kyiv.[5] She and Marynchuk did not have time to get married before he went to war; he did not
                    return,[4] dying in Finland.[5] Prymachenko's brother was killed by the Nazis. She returned to
                    Ivankiv and worked on a collective farm.[4] Fedir also became a folk artist and a master of naiveté;
                    he died in 2008. Prymachenko's grandsons Petro and Ivan also became artists.[5]

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>
                    The 1936 First Republican Exhibition of Folk Art featured Prymachenko's paintings. This exhibition
                    was shown in Moscow, Leningrad, and Warsaw. Prymachenko was awarded a first-degree diploma for
                    participating in this exhibition of folk art. In 1937, the artist's works were exhibited in
                    Paris.[2]

                    Prymachenko's works were inspired by Ukrainian, and in particular Polesian, folk traditions. They
                    include references to the natural world and to fairy-tales.[6][7] During the 1930s, she made a
                    transition from embroidery to painting, and her works from this period are painted onto white
                    backgrounds. Her bold and expressive linework was developing and she was combining traditional
                    Ukrainian motifs in new ways.[2]

                    During the 1960s to 1980s, her style continued to develop, with paintings having an increasingly
                    vibrant colour palette and a new choice of bright backgrounds for her works. At this time she moved
                    from working in watercolour to working in gouache. In the 1970s, Prymachenko also began to include
                    short phrases or proverbs on the reverse of her canvases, which related to the topic of the work.[2]
